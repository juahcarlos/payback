This is a monorepo with a simple backend service working with one payment  
system, and a Docker-based crontab service running Python scripts for  
scheduled jobs.

The full project is much bigger — with more APIs, services, and features —  
but here it’s been heavily reduced to just the essentials for demonstration.

This code not supposed to be downloaded and run as-is,
because some resources such as databases and others are not included.
The purpose of creating this repo is just to show the code.
